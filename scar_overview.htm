<h1>Introduction to SCAR</h1>
<p class="c1">SCAR stands for &quot;Scripting at Relic&quot;. Our script files utilize the Lua language which is an open
source programming language. Lua has been used at Relic for several generations of games because of its versatile nature
and fast implementation time.</p>
<h2>Which Files?</h2>
<p class="c1">When we write scripts for the game each map will, by default, contain several core files. All of the files
are linked through the use of a common name. For the purposes of this example we will refer to a set of files for
&quot;Mission_01&quot;.</p>
<p class="c1">Located in Dawn of War\W40K\Data\Scenarios\SP</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Mission_01.scar - <i>User defined SCAR file, contains script that controls the flow of the main mission events
        and objectives.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01.nis - <i>User defined NIS file, contains script that controls the flow of Non-Interactive Sequences.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01.sgb - <i>Default map data file. Contains all of the object, player, marker, lighting, decal, height
        map, etc.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01.tga - <i>Default world texture. Generated by the Mission Editor, this is the image that defines the
        base texture. The information in the *.sgb file then applies all detail textures and decals on top of this
        layer.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01_icon.tga - <i>Default icon image. Generated by the Mission Editor, this is the image displayed in the
        Game Setup screen when choosing a map.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01_mm.tga - <i>Default mini map image. Generated by the Mission Editor, this is the image displayed in
        the taskbar in-game.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01_mm_custom.tga - <i>Optional, custom mini map file. In Dawn of War maps you will notice the custom
        file. This was to polish the quality beyond that of the default generated mini map, and to apply features such
        as numbered starting locations.</i></li>
    <li>Mission_01_hm.tga - <i>Optional, this is the height map. This file is nonessential. The actual height map data
        is stored in the *.sgb file.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="c1">Located in Dawn of War\W40K\Data\Scenarios\SP\Loading</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Mission_01.tga - <i>Loading screen image.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="c1">Located in Dawn of War\W40K\Locale\English</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>W40k.ucs - <i>Localized string file. Defines a range of numbers and associated text strings for easy
        localization. Number range must be unique or it will crash the game when you try to load. *WARNING* - if there
        is an error with this file, (note it will crash the GAME on load not the MISSION because ALL of the text data is
        loaded when the game first loads not just the pre-game text. Relic does not advise the modification of this
        file. Edit at your own risk.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="c1">And located in Dawn of War\W40K\Data\Scar</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>ScarUtil.scar - <i>A reference file that defines commonly used Utility functions, which are functions defined in
        Lua that most scripts rely on in addition to core C++ functions.<br>
        *WARNING* - This file should not be edited as doing so may break all other scenarios.</i></li>
