<h1>SCAR Editor</h1>
<p class="c1">We use SCitE to write our script files. SCitE is a free source code editor which handles LUA as well as a
number of other languages. When you first run SCitE set the language to Lu<u>a</u> in the Language dropdown (Ctrl+L).</p>
<p class="c1"><b>SCitE</b> - <a href="http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/SciTE.html">http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/SciTE.html</a></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p class="c1">Some features of SCitE we will be taking advantage of include:</p>
<p class="c1"><b>API Auto Complete</b> - If the function we are writing exists in the API a list box will appear when
you start writing that function with all the possible endings. <i>*NOTE - This feature is not immediately available but
will be forthcoming.</i></p>
<p class="c4"><img src="image001.jpg" alt="img" width="279" height="84"></p>
<p class="c1"><b>User Defined Auto Complete</b> - If you hit &quot;Ctrl+Enter&quot; SCitE will display a list of
everything in the document you are working on that starts with what you are typing. For example if you type
&quot;r&quot; then hit auto complete you might get a list that looks like this:</p>
<p class="c4"><img src="image002.jpg" alt="img" width="219" height="87"></p>
<p class="c1"><b>Function Query</b> - As you write a function that is already in the API SCitE will show you what the
function wants so you don't have to refer to a SCARDocto look it up. If this disappears and you want to get it back you
can press &quot;(&quot; twice to see it again. <i>*NOTE - This feature is not immediately available but will be
forthcoming.</i></p>
<p class="c4"><img src="image003.jpg" alt="img" width="473" height="46"></p>
<p class="c1"><b>Highlighting and Coloring</b> - ScitE will automatically highlight or color certain aspects of your
script.</p>
<p class="c4"><img src="image004.jpg" alt="img" width="260" height="20"></p>
<p class="c1"><b>CTRL+F7 Compile</b> - if you hit &quot;CTRL+F7&quot; SCitE will test compile your script and let you
know certain formatting errors that would keep the game from running the script. It won't test game functions but will
let you know if your script is missing things like &quot;end&quot;s or opening or closing brackets. Below is a good
compile and a broken script.</p>
<p class="c4"><img src="image005.jpg" alt="img" width="371" height="77"></p>
<p><b>F5 Compile</b> - If you write a test script for logic with no game specific functions SCitE will compile it and
show the output in the Output Window (F8). Be sure to save the file type as .lua. This is a good way to practice writing
simple scripts or to do the <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory">tutorials on the LUA site.</a></p>
